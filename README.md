It's a basic project where data is retrieved with Fetch, using vanilla Javascript. Credits: https://www.youtube.com/c/FalconMasters

Youtube channel dedicated to teach about Frontend development, the founder is __Carlos Arturo Esparza__. This is a really easy practice where I learned how to call an
API and retrieve data from it. It's a fake cinema that is showing a lot of movies, just images and the name of the movie.

It was really educative because I could understand how __Fetch__ works and now I use it very often.
